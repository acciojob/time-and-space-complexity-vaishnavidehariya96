  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. 
    A lower time complexity generally means the algorithm is more efficient and faster to execute.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> defines how much memory an algorithm needs relative to the input size. 
    Typically, an algorithm with lower space usage, such as O(n), is considered better for memory optimization.
