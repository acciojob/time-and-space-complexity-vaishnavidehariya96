  <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total memory space required by an algorithm to execute completely. It includes both auxiliary space and input space. For example, an algorithm with linear <b>Space Complexity</b> can be represented as O(n).
