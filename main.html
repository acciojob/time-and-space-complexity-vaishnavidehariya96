  <h1>Understanding Time, Space and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. Time complexity helps us reason about how efficient an algorithm is and compare different approaches in terms of execution time.

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run, including input and auxiliary space. For example, an algorithm that uses an amount of memory proportional to the input size has space usage described as O(n).
